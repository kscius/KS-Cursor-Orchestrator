# Root Cause Tracing

## Overview

Bugs often manifest deep in the call stack. Your instinct is to fix where the error appears, but that's treating a symptom.

**Core principle:** Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original trigger, then fix at the source.

## When to Use

- Error happens deep in execution (not at entry point)
- Stack trace shows long call chain
- Unclear where invalid data originated
- Need to find which test/code triggers the problem

## The Tracing Process

### 1. Observe the Symptom
```
Error: git init failed in /Users/jesse/project/packages/core
```

### 2. Find Immediate Cause
**What code directly causes this?**
```typescript
await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: projectDir });
```

### 3. Ask: What Called This?
```typescript
WorktreeManager.createSessionWorktree(projectDir, sessionId)
  → called by Session.initializeWorkspace()
  → called by Session.create()
  → called by test at Project.create()
```

### 4. Keep Tracing Up
**What value was passed?**
- `projectDir = ''` (empty string!)
- Empty string as `cwd` resolves to `process.cwd()`

### 5. Find Original Trigger
**Where did empty string come from?**
```typescript
const context = setupCoreTest(); // Returns { tempDir: '' }
Project.create('name', context.tempDir); // Accessed before beforeEach!
```

## Adding Stack Traces When Manual Tracing Fails

```typescript
async function gitInit(directory: string) {
  const stack = new Error().stack;
  console.error('DEBUG git init:', {
    directory,
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    stack,
  });
  await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: directory });
}
```

**Use `console.error()` in tests** — loggers may be suppressed.

**Capture:**
```bash
npm test 2>&1 | grep 'DEBUG git init'
```

## Key Principle

**NEVER fix just where the error appears.** Trace back to find the original trigger.

After fixing at source, add validation at each layer (see `defense-in-depth.md`).

## Stack Trace Tips

- Use `console.error()` not logger — may be suppressed in tests
- Log **before** the dangerous operation, not after it fails
- Include directory, cwd, env vars, timestamps
- Capture full stack: `new Error().stack`
